Economic Simulation Model (Java &amp; Script Integration)
Developed a simulation framework for economic models, where calculations ran over multiple periods. Implemented a controller class to manage input data, execute calculations, and generate results in a structured format. Enabled script execution (e.g., Groovy, Python) for extended data analysis and model interactions.
